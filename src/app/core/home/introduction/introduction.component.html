            My name is Ryan Kline, I am a full-stack software engineer based out of
            West Michigan specializing in web, mobile, and IoT products. I graduated from Grand Valley State University
            in December of 2023 with my Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science, and have been working in the
            industry for over two years now.

            Over the last two years, I've had the privledge to work on several projects of various scopes, industries,
            and companies. Whether its working on a large development team utilizing the SAFe Agile framework, a group of interdisciplinary
            engineers building a product from the ground up, or tinkering with a new side project, each experience has provided me the opportunity
            to adapt my skillset, communicate across teams, and embrace the unique challenges that each project presents.
